Developed a high-accuracy **land cover classification model** using the **EuroSAT dataset** and **MobileNetV2**, enabling efficient feature extraction for satellite imagery analysis. The model accurately classifies images into 10 distinct land categories, such as forests, farmland, residential, and industrial areas, achieving an impressive 97% accuracy. Preprocessing steps included resizing images to 224x224, and the model was fine-tuned using Adam optimizer, a batch size of 16, and a learning rate of 0.001, ensuring optimal performance for remote sensing applications.
