A comprehensive analysis of NYC crime trends to uncover patterns in crime prevalence, borough-specific insights, and demographic factors. The project leverages **Tableau** to create interactive visualizations that showcase crime dynamics across precincts, time periods, and demographics. Completed as part of **Northeastern University's ALY6070 course** under **Jack Bergerson**, the analysis provides data-driven insights for law enforcement and policy-making.
